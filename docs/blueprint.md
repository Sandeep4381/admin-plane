## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Orange (#E87132) for highlights and key actions, aligning with the SawariKaro brand.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to create a clean, white content area contrasting with a darker sidebar.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of orange (#D16329) used for hover states and secondary actions to provide visual feedback.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern and neutral appearance suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use vehicle-themed icons to represent different sections and actions within the dashboard, such as cars, scooters, and location markers. Use simple, outline-style icons for a clean look.
- Implement a responsive layout with a fixed dark sidebar for primary navigation and a white content area with rounded cards and clean tables to display information.
- Use subtle animations, such as fade-in effects and smooth transitions, when loading data or navigating between sections to enhance the user experience.
